# How do I approach designing software?
I now have a much better idea of 3D concepts, which will certainly help me in the future of my development. I've cemented my knowledge of working with matrices and vertices in development. With this course I really emphasized reusability with my code. I believe when defining my verts, I could've automated the definition of vertices, normals, etc... However I was able to easily create a movable camera, lighting, and objects due to the objects not being dependent on hard-coded values.  

# How do I approach developing programs?
The main program contained a while loop, which I used to render all of the objects until the user escaped the program. Without the while loop, the program would've worked much differently. I feel that my main program was also kept relatively clean, due to my function definitions and utilization of library calls taking up most of the space. All I had to do was pass arguments through, which made the main program very readable. Each milestone, I added more and more logic to my program until the final. I really enjoyed being able to progressively learn while adding what I've learned to the project, rather than throwing it all together at once.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Learning about computational graphics and visualizations will be very beneficial to my educational and professional pathway. If I ever wanted to design a website and utilize WebGL or ThreeJs, for example, I know have the fundamental knowledge for setting up graphical programs. I plan on expanding on my knowledge of writing shaders as well, as developing computer graphics has been fascinating for me.
